   - Tap to open voice booking dialog

2. **Voice Commands to Try:**

   ```
   "Book a deluxe room for Shajil Thaniyath from tomorrow to Friday"
   "Reserve a suite for Ashok for 3 nights starting Monday"
   "I need a standard room for Sarah from December 15th to 18th"
   ```

3. **Voice Workflow:**
   - Tap microphone button ‚Üí Starts listening
   - Speak your booking request clearly
